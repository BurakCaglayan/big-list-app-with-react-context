# Big List App With React Context

#### Description

Big List App With React Context App, is a simple, almost responsive application developed using React, React Hooks, Context Api & React-window.
In this project, a case study has been made on how to display big data without performance issues. Of course something has more than one solution. And better it can be ofcourse.
The general logic of the project is: Even if you have a large amount of data, is it possible to render only the visible part on the screen? So how do we do this?
This application was created to meet the answer to the above questions.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow steps:

### Prerequisites

This project is currently not dependent on any back-end, database or prerequisites. You can continue with the steps below.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/BurakCaglayan/big-list-app-with-react-context.git
   ```

2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start Project

   ```JS
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Scroll up and down the page, resize it and test it on low-processor mobile devices to see if the big data existing in the project is causing any problems.
Add data to the cart by clicking on the numerical ratios. If you click on the same rate again, see that the data is removed. And look how fast these work.
For detailed review, please don't forget to examine the elements by opening chrome in developer mode while scrolling. You can also use the React components tool. In this way, you can understand the working logic.

### What could be better? What can be added?
- The design does not look exactly like a table. This may cause some problems in terms of seeing the ratios.
- Design improvements can also be made for the basket.
- For scss, 7+1 patterns could be used or each style could be found in its own component file.
- It would be nice if there was time left for the refactor. There are components and lines that need to be refactored.

### What have I tried in this app?
- I researched and developed how to display big data on a single page in a performance way.
- I tried to create the file structure specifically so that it can be used in a large project.
- Although its design is troublesome, I have developed an application that will work even on phones with low processors. If I make improvements on the design, everything can be much better.
- It's the first time I've published a repo on gitHub pages. And I learned how this process goes.
